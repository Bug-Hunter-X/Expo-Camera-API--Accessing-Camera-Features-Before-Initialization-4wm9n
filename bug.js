This error occurs when using the Expo Camera API and trying to access the camera's features before the camera has fully initialized.  This often manifests as undefined values or errors when attempting to use properties like `camera.takePictureAsync()` or `camera.getSupportedRatiosAsync()` before the camera is ready.
