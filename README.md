# Expo Camera API Initialization Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API: attempting to access camera features before the camera has fully initialized. This can result in undefined values or errors when calling methods like `takePictureAsync()`.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` presents a corrected version that utilizes the `onCameraReady` callback to ensure the camera is ready before attempting any operations.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run `expo start`. 
4. Observe the error in the console of `bug.js`.
5. Switch to `bugSolution.js` to see how to correctly handle camera initialization.

## Solution

Always use the `onCameraReady` callback provided by the Expo Camera API to ensure the camera is initialized before using its methods. This prevents errors and ensures reliable operation.
